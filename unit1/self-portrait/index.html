        For my project I decided to create a protrait based on the number of gundam episodes
        I have watched. Each gundam series has their own respective gundam model. For instance
        The original gundam has the RX-78, Zeta Gundam has Zeta Gundam, and Iron Blooded Orphans
        has Barbatos. I will be making a collage of gundam images based on the order in which
        I have watched the franchise.

        This is quanititve data to show how many gundam series I have watched.
